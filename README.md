The purpose of this task was to create an AU/VST3 plugin using the JUCE library and Projucer application.<br/>
The plugin designed in this report was a distortion filter. Made combining a ladder filter from the JUCE dsp module and some nonlinear processing functions.<br/>

## Method
1. Implementing JUCE dsp ladder filter
2. Adding distortion dsp code
3. Creating Parameters
4. Creating Sliders and customising GUI
